    "title": "Alecta Sells $8B US Treasuries Amid Political Risks",
    "body": "Sweden’s major pension fund Alecta has offloaded most of its US Treasury bond holdings, with sales estimated between 70 and 80 billion SEK (around $8 billion). The fund attributes this significant reduction to growing concerns over political instability and unpredictability in the United States, reflecting a broader cautious stance on sovereign debt amid uncertain global economic conditions. This strategic shift underscores how geopolitical factors are influencing institutional portfolio allocations.\n\nConcurrently, Swedish investment firm Flerie is capitalizing on a rising investor appetite for stable yet innovative exposure within the life sciences sector. Specializing in private and hard-to-access biotech companies, Flerie manages a diversified portfolio of 25 firms, with 77% of capital allocated to private entities spanning cardiovascular, oncology, metabolic, rare, and immunological diseases. Their evergreen investment approach combines long-term commitment with active portfolio evaluation, enabling ongoing support for companies demonstrating value creation.\n\nFlerie’s model also leverages a broad international syndicate network across Europe, the US, and Asia to secure funding even in challenging market environments. Since listing on Nasdaq Stockholm in June 2024, the firm has witnessed growing interest from investors seeking balanced risk exposure in life sciences, a sector known for its high potential but also significant volatility. This trend highlights a shift toward investment vehicles that provide access to early-stage innovations without the typical liquidity constraints.\n\nTogether, these developments illustrate a dual narrative: institutional investors like Alecta are recalibrating sovereign debt exposure due to geopolitical risks, while specialized firms like Flerie are meeting demand for diversified, risk-managed access to transformative biotech innovations.",
