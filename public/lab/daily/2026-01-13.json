    "title": "Former Leaders Urge Support for Fed Independence",
    "body": "A group of prominent former Federal Reserve chairs and U.S. Treasury secretaries recently released a joint statement emphasizing the necessity of preserving the Federal Reserve's independence. This collective message comes amid intensified political debates over the Fed's aggressive interest rate increases that began in 2022 to tackle persistent inflation. The signatories argue that safeguarding the Fed's autonomy is essential to maintaining its credibility and effectiveness in steering the economy.\n\nThe statement highlights that political interference risks destabilizing financial markets and diminishing public confidence in monetary policy. Given the Fed’s pivotal role in controlling inflation and fostering sustainable economic growth, the former officials warn that any erosion of its independence could have severe second-order effects, including increased market volatility and impaired policy outcomes.\n\nThey advocate for a continued commitment to a data-driven approach, allowing the Fed to adjust policies responsively as economic conditions evolve. This stance reflects a broader consensus among experienced policymakers that central bank independence remains a cornerstone of economic stability, especially in times of heightened inflationary pressures and uncertain global economic dynamics.",
