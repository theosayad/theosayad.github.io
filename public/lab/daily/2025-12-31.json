  "summary": "Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court, was sanctioned by the US Treasury on August 20, 2025, for authorizing arrest warrants against Israeli officials accused of war crimes. This move is part of a broader US effort targeting ICC personnel, effectively isolating them from the global financial system and complicating their judicial functions.",

    "title": "US Sanctions French ICC Judge Over Israel Warrants",
    "body": "On August 20, 2025, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court (ICC), citing his role in authorizing arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Both Israeli officials face allegations of war crimes related to the Gaza Strip conflict. This sanction is part of a broader US campaign targeting ICC personnel, including six judges and three prosecutors such as Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan.\n\nThe sanctions, originally designed to combat terrorism, human rights abuses, and drug trafficking, have expanded to include nearly 15,000 individuals worldwide. The inclusion of ICC judges signals an unprecedented politicization of international judicial processes, effectively blacklisting these officials from much of the global banking system. Guillou described the impact as severe, highlighting difficulties in conducting daily work and financial transactions due to 'debanking.'\n\nThese measures raise concerns about the independence of international justice and the ability of ICC officials to operate without external interference. Guillou has called on European authorities to implement protective mechanisms to shield ICC members from the extraterritorial reach of US sanctions. The situation underscores growing tensions between US foreign policy priorities and multilateral judicial institutions, with potential long-term implications for international law enforcement and cooperation.",
