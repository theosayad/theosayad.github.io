    "title": "AT&T, Verizon Withhold Salt Typhoon Security Reports",
    "body": "Telecom giants AT&T and Verizon are reportedly preventing the release of security evaluation reports prepared by Salt Typhoon, a cybersecurity firm specializing in infrastructure risk assessments. These reports assess vulnerabilities within the carriers’ networks, particularly as they expand 5G coverage across the United States. The decision to withhold these findings has drawn criticism from lawmakers concerned about transparency and the robustness of national telecommunications security.\n\nSalt Typhoon’s assessments are considered crucial for identifying potential weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors, especially given the strategic importance of 5G networks in both civilian and defense contexts. A U.S. senator publicly called attention to the carriers’ efforts to block the reports, signaling that this issue may escalate into a regulatory or legislative matter.\n\nThe timing of this controversy is notable, coinciding with increased geopolitical tensions and a broader push to secure critical infrastructure against cyber threats. The lack of public access to these security evaluations may hinder informed oversight and limit consumer awareness regarding the safety of their communications networks. This situation underscores the ongoing challenges in balancing corporate confidentiality with public interest in the telecommunications sector’s cybersecurity posture.",
