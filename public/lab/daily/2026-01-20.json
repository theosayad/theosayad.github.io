  "summary": "The 2025 US tariffs on imports have effectively imposed nearly the entire cost on American importers and consumers, with foreign exporters absorbing a minimal share. This pass-through has led to a sharp increase in US customs revenue but also significant trade volume declines, highlighting the tariffs' counterproductive economic impact.",

    "96% of the 2025 US tariff costs are passed to American importers and consumers; foreign exporters absorb only about 4%.",

    "US customs revenue increased by approximately $200 billion in 2025, funded almost entirely by domestic buyers.",

    "body": "The 2025 US tariffs have largely backfired by placing the financial burden almost entirely on American importers and consumers rather than foreign exporters. Detailed shipment-level data encompassing over 25 million transactions valued at nearly $4 trillion reveals that about 96% of tariff costs are passed through to US buyers, with foreign exporters absorbing a mere 4%. This dynamic resulted in a substantial surge in US customs revenue, which rose by roughly $200 billion in 2025, effectively functioning as a tax paid by American consumers.\n\nEvent studies focusing on significant tariff hikes—50% on Brazilian goods and between 25% and 50% on Indian products—demonstrate that export prices remained largely unchanged. Instead of lowering prices to share the tariff burden, exporters reduced shipment volumes, leading to a collapse in trade flows. Indian customs data corroborates this pattern, showing exporters maintained their price levels and cut back on shipments rather than absorbing tariff costs.\n\nThese findings underscore the limited effectiveness of tariffs as a tool to shift costs onto foreign producers. Instead, the tariffs have raised import prices domestically, negatively affecting US consumers and importers while reducing trade volumes. The resulting increase in customs revenue reflects a transfer of wealth within the US economy rather than from foreign exporters. Policymakers should consider these second-order effects when designing trade interventions, as tariffs may undermine economic welfare without achieving intended leverage over trading partners.",
