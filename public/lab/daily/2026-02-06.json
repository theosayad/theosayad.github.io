    "title": "Bitcoin Price Target Slashed to Zero by Strategist",
    "body": "In a striking development, Richard Farr, chief market strategist and partner at Pivotus Partners, has projected Bitcoin’s price could ultimately collapse to zero. This forecast is not merely provocative but reflects deep-seated concerns about Bitcoin’s future as a reliable store of value or investment vehicle. Farr’s outlook emerges amid a backdrop of increasing regulatory scrutiny and persistent market turbulence that have shaken investor confidence.\n\nThe zero price target aligns with warnings from other notable investors, such as Michael Burry, who have voiced skepticism about Bitcoin’s fundamentals and speculative nature. Regulatory moves worldwide, including crackdowns on exchanges and tightening compliance requirements, have intensified uncertainty around cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, Bitcoin’s notorious price volatility continues to challenge its adoption as a mainstream asset.\n\nFarr’s prediction signals a broader apprehension that Bitcoin may fail to maintain its market relevance or value proposition in the long term. If realized, such a collapse would have significant implications for the wider crypto ecosystem, potentially triggering contagion effects across digital assets and related financial products. Investors and market participants should weigh these downside risks carefully as the regulatory and macroeconomic environment evolves.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience in past downturns, this stark forecast serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent risks and the evolving challenges it faces in gaining sustained legitimacy within global financial markets.",
