    "title": "Japan Bond Sell-Off Threatens Global Markets",
    "body": "In early 2026, Japan's government bond market experienced a dramatic sell-off, shaking confidence in what has long been considered a stable cornerstone of global finance. Approximately $7 trillion of Japanese government debt came under pressure as investors reacted to signals that the Bank of Japan might unwind its longstanding ultra-loose monetary policies. This shift in sentiment led to a spike in bond yields, unsettling markets worldwide.\n\nThe Bank of Japan's potential policy pivot is significant because it challenges decades of near-zero interest rates designed to stimulate a sluggish economy. Rising yields in Japan not only increase borrowing costs domestically but also risk pushing up global interest rates, given Japan's central role as a major creditor nation and holder of foreign assets. This interconnectedness means that volatility in Japan's bond market can ripple through international financial systems, affecting everything from currency valuations to cross-border capital flows.\n\nMoreover, the sell-off underscores deeper structural issues within Japan, including its aging population and mounting debt levels, which raise questions about long-term fiscal sustainability. Investors are increasingly wary that these demographic and economic pressures could force more abrupt policy changes, intensifying market instability. The episode serves as a warning that even traditionally safe government debt markets are vulnerable to shifts in monetary policy and investor sentiment, with potential consequences far beyond Japan's borders.",
