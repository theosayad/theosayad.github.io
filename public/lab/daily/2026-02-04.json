    "title": "Anthropic AI Launch Triggers Legal Software Selloff",
    "body": "On February 3, 2026, Anthropic unveiled a new AI tool tailored for the legal software market, sparking an immediate and sharp decline in shares of companies operating in this sector. The announcement intensified investor anxiety about the disruptive potential of AI technologies, which are increasingly capable of automating complex professional tasks traditionally handled by specialized software.\n\nLegal software stocks bore the brunt of the selloff, with some firms experiencing double-digit percentage drops in their share prices. This sector-specific downturn also rippled through the broader technology market, as investors reassessed the vulnerability of established software providers to rapid AI-driven innovation. The market reaction signals a shift in sentiment, where the threat of AI disruption is no longer theoretical but actively influencing valuations.\n\nThe incident highlights a broader trend of AI integration into niche industries, accelerating competitive pressures and forcing incumbents to adapt swiftly or risk obsolescence. As AI tools become more sophisticated and accessible, traditional software companies face heightened challenges to maintain their market positions. This dynamic is likely to fuel ongoing volatility in tech stocks tied to enterprise software solutions.\n\nOverall, Anthropic's AI tool launch serves as a catalyst, emphasizing the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on specialized software markets and the broader investment landscape.",
