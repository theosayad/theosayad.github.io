    "title": "Costco Joins Lawsuit Against Trump-Era Tariffs",
    "body": "Costco has formally joined a coalition of companies suing the Trump administration over tariffs imposed on imported goods, particularly those originating from China. These tariffs, introduced as part of the administration's trade policy starting in 2018, have significantly increased costs for retailers reliant on global supply chains. By challenging these levies in court, Costco and its allies argue that the tariffs disrupt business operations and inflate prices for consumers.\n\nThe legal action underscores widespread corporate dissatisfaction with the protectionist measures, which many companies view as counterproductive to free trade and economic efficiency. Retailers like Costco, which operate on thin margins and high volume, are particularly vulnerable to cost increases stemming from tariffs. The lawsuit aims to push back against these policies and potentially shape future trade enforcement.\n\nIf successful, this challenge could lead to a rollback or modification of existing tariffs, easing pressure on supply chains and consumer prices. It also signals a broader trend of businesses seeking judicial remedies to trade disputes, reflecting concerns about the long-term impact of tariff-driven trade tensions on the U.S. economy.",
