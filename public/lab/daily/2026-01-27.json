    "title": "Global Water Crisis Triggers 'Bankruptcy' for Billions",
    "body": "A growing global water crisis is pushing billions into what scientists describe as a 'water bankruptcy' era, where freshwater resources are insufficient to meet demand. Currently, over two billion people live under conditions of water scarcity, a figure expected to rise sharply by 2030 as population growth and urbanization increase consumption. The situation is worsened by the unsustainable extraction of groundwater, particularly in key agricultural zones, where reserves are being depleted faster than natural recharge rates.\n\nClimate change compounds these challenges by intensifying droughts and reducing surface water availability, further straining supplies. This convergence of factors threatens global food security, as water shortages disrupt crop production and heighten the risk of famine. Economic stability is also at risk, especially in regions heavily dependent on agriculture and water-intensive industries.\n\nAddressing this crisis requires urgent, coordinated action. Experts emphasize the need for integrated water resource management, investment in water-saving technologies, and international cooperation to ensure equitable distribution. Without such measures, the 'water bankruptcy' era could lead to widespread humanitarian and economic consequences, underscoring water's critical role in sustaining life and development worldwide.",
