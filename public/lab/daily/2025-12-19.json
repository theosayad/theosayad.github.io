    "title": "UK Security Law Risks Overreaching on Encryption",
    "body": "Jonathan Hall KC, the UK government’s Independent Reviewer of State Threats and Terrorism Legislation, has issued a critical report highlighting the overly broad scope of powers granted under recent national security laws. His review of the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act alongside the newly enacted National Security Act warns that developers of encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp could be legally classified as engaging in 'hostile activity' simply because their technology impedes UK intelligence agencies’ ability to monitor communications. This expansive interpretation extends to journalists carrying sensitive or politically damaging information, raising concerns about press freedom and civil liberties.\n\nThe report emerges amid escalating legislative efforts to curb encryption in the UK. Apple notably resisted a technical capability notice under the Investigatory Powers Act demanding it weaken iCloud encryption, choosing instead to disable its Advanced Data Protection feature. Meanwhile, the Online Safety Act, currently under parliamentary debate, is moving toward stricter enforcement measures, including calls to review encrypted tools like VPNs. Despite a public petition for repeal, MPs pushed for tougher implementation, revealing a disconnect between lawmakers’ law enforcement priorities and experts’ warnings about privacy risks.\n\nDigital rights advocates emphasize that encryption is crucial not only for protecting individual privacy but also for national security, as weakening it could expose users to cyberattacks and surveillance abuses. Vulnerable groups such as dissidents, journalists, and domestic abuse victims rely heavily on secure communications. With UK lawmakers framing encryption primarily as a barrier to security, services like Signal and WhatsApp face an uncertain future, having previously threatened to exit the UK market rather than compromise user privacy. This report signals a challenging environment ahead for encrypted communication providers and digital rights in the UK.",
